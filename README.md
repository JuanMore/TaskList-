# TaskList-
This task list app uses materialize for the UI and Vanilla JS for functionality. Inspired by a Brad Traversy. This was a great project to work on as I love to learn and continue to utilize Javascript.  My main goals with projects like these are to become proficient in javascript and hone down on those fundamentals.
